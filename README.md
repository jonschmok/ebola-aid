# [UBC BEST Ebola Aid Project](http://best.ece.ubc.ca/team/ebola-aid/)
The UBC BEST Ebola Aid Team has been working on a project that addresses the need for an efficient and organized method for recording and tracking the vitals, symptoms, and progress of patients being treated in Ebola Treatment Centres (ETC) in West Africa. As many ETCs in West Africa lack the proper infrastructure (cellular network, internet access) necessary to implement a standard Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, we are developing a simple, and cost-effective system that operates within each facility on a local mesh network, without the need for cellular network or internet access. Healthcare workers can input patient information in high-risk areas of the facility via a user-friendly tablet application, which can be transferred over a local mesh network and stored in a secure database. Data can be retrieved and viewed in low-risk areas of the facility via a central computer.
